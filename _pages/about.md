I am a second-year Master student in Dept. Computer Science of Southeast University and advised by Prof. [Fang Dong](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2019/0102/c23024a256994/page.htm). I recieved Bachelor's degree at Jiangsu University. My research interests mainly include edge intelligence and deep learning, specially lie in the DNN model deployment, heterogeneous computing and machine learning compilation. I am also absorbed in studying the algorithm and mechanism of multi-object tracking.

## Publications
